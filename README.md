# Restaurant Data Analysis

## Summary | Problem Statement

### Summary :
Machine Learning Project where we done analysis on Zomato dataset using historic data.This model wil predict the estimated cost for two people based on various factor of curtain Restaurants. 

### About Dataset :
 * [Zomato Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavuikey/zomato-eda)
    - Data Cleaning:
        - Deleting redundant columns.
        - Renaming the columns.
        - Dropping duplicates.
        - Cleaning individual columns.
        - Remove the NaN values from the dataset
        - Check for some more Transformations
    - Data Columns:
        - Restaurants delivering Online or not
        - Restaurants allowing table booking or not
        - Table booking Rate vs Rate
        - Best Location
        - Relation between Location and Rating
        - Restaurant Type
        - Gaussian Rest type and Rating
        - Types of Services
        - Relation between Type and Rating
        - Cost of Restaurant
        - No. of restaurants in a Location
        - Restaurant type
  
     
### Problem Statement :  
We are trying to use a restaurant data set to predict the ratings of two people based on different characteristics of the restaurant. The dataset contains information about the city, location, type of cuisine served, price, rating, and more. The goal is to use this data to develop a model that can accurately predict two people's ratings  based on restaurant characteristics. This can be done by creating a regression model that uses restaurant characteristics to predict the rating The model can then be used to predict two people's rating  for a particular restaurant

## Basic Analysis
### Analysis of Text Data
 
>>
    * Checking average of character each sentence have.
![foxdemo](https://github.com/SarkarPriyanshu/Sentiment_Predict/blob/master/Graphs/img1.png?raw=true)
    
    * The average word length ranges
![foxdemo](https://github.com/SarkarPriyanshu/Sentiment_Predict/blob/master/Graphs/img2.png?raw=true)

    * the number of words appearing in each news highlights.
![foxdemo](https://github.com/SarkarPriyanshu/Sentiment_Predict/blob/master/Graphs/img3.png?raw=true)    
    
    * Which stopwords occur frequently in our text, letâ€™s inspect which words other than these stopwords occur frequently?

    * Top 50 most occuring words

    * Bigram and trigram

## Data Cleaning
>   After analying have to deal with multiple sub problems
> ### Sub Problems we faced working with this data
>>
    * Removing special charecters, symbols and many noisy raw text data.
    * Need to remove stopwords.
    * Converting text to lowercase for narmalisation 
    * Converting emogi if present to utf-8 format.
>

## Data Preprocessing
### Preprocessing steps

>   After analying have to deal with multiple sub problems
> ### Steps we follow in preprocessing steps
>>
    * Normalisation of text
    * Tokenize words and further clean-up text
    * Removing stopwords
    * Applying bigram and trigram
    * Stemming and lemmatisation
    * Sentiment Predictor using flair library

### Observation after preprocessing
>>
![foxdemo](https://github.com/SarkarPriyanshu/Sentiment_Predict/blob/master/Graphs/img7.png?raw=true)
    
    * Data we produce using flair library was imbalanced so we have applied various methods later for better predictive model.

## Model Selection and Evaluations

## Deal with imbalanced data
> ### Under Samplying Techniques 
>>
    * Random Under samplying
    * NearMiss
        * NearMiss version 1
        * NearMiss version 2
        * NearMiss version 3

> ### Over Samplying Techniques
    * Random Over Samplying
    * Random Over Samplying with smoothing
    * SMOTE
    * ADASYN
    
> ### Observation
    * From the obove observation we got logistic regression is best performer for predicting sentiment for our dataset and NearMiss under sampling is giving best result for handling unbalance dataset
